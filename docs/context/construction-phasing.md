# Construction Phasing

This terminology is included for context of development of the software package as a whole. Giving a place for non construction people to reference when features or issues are created discussing pinch points and their application for end users in their daily lives.

While some organizations such as the American Institute of Architects (AIA), Project Management Institute (PMI) and the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) guide the phases and documentation that should be used for a construction project, there are no standard construction phases that are agreed upon by most constructors. Each construction firm manages construction projects slightly differently.

Project phasing involves the sequential breakdown of a construction project into a series of defined stages or phases. Each phase encompasses a set of tasks that must be completed before moving on to the next, creating a logical flow of activities.

## Design Phase

The design phase is completed by architects, engineers, designers and project stakeholders, often collectively referred to as the design team. They map out the approval process for the project and set everything in place to build. Within this phase are several distinct steps, which some relevant ones are outlined below

- **Site Analysis:** is conducted to determine the size of the building or structure,including how much space it’ll take up, the rooms that’ll be in the building and so on. Once these decisions are made, a project initiation document is created.
- **Construction Documentation and Architectural Drawings:** During this step, all construction documentation will be produced. There are a lot of documents to be produced when planning a construction project. Here’s a quick definition of the most important ones:
    - **Architectural Drawings:** Provide visual representations of a building or structure with information about dimensions, materials and design intent.
    - **Scope of Work:** Outlines specific tasks, deliverables and timelines for a project and acts as an agreement between the client and contractor.
    - **Construction Plan:** The construction plan as a comprehensive guide for all stakeholders and details how the project will be executed.
    - **Computer-Assisted Designs:** The use of software to create specific drawings, models and specifications for different design projects.
    - **Construction Budget:** Serves as a detailed financial plan that outlines the estimated costs of a construction project.
    - **Construction Specifications:** Written descriptions of the materials, standards and procedures needed for a construction project.

## Procurement Phase (Bidding Phase)

As the name suggests, the procurement phase of the construction project is when the design team solicits the project for construction. Depending on the scope of the project, they may choose a number of different ways to solicit a general contractor or construction manager who will then oversee the actual construction of the project.

Naturally, the scope of the project is going to make this a relatively simple phase or a much more challenging one. Not only the scope but also the availability of resources and the start date will all have an impact on how smoothly this phase is completed.

During this phase contractors are issued construction or bidding documents in order to analyze and compile proposals. Subcontractors will prepare similar proposals for their specific trades to either a construction manager or general contractor who is preparing a complete bid or budget to send to the design team. Contractors will refer to these as estimates and proposals, and are the definining documents for their respective scope of work. The data generated by contractors during this phase is used throughout the life of the construction project.

## Preconstruction Phase

Preconstruction is where foundational planning takes place. In this phase general contractors and subcontractors are brought on board to a project and begin laying out their individual plans to help with their respective trades in the project. Key activities in this phase are listed below.

- **Site Preparation:** The project team starts preparing for work, setting up the job site so that it’s ready for construction. This includes pre-construction meetings, working with schematic design, other construction drawings and the construction schedule. The construction budget will also be referred to as well as the larger construction plan. Clearing the site, grading and addressing any necessary environmental considerations.
- **Permitting:** Obtaining the required building permits to comply with local regulations, building codes, zoning laws, and safety standards.
- **Utility Coordination:** Setting up temporary power, water and sewer connections and coordinating with utility providers so that these services are available when construction begins.
- **Stormwater Management:** Implementing erosion control measures to protect the site and surrounding areas.
- **MObilization:** Bringing equipment and crews onsite to prepare for the start of construction.

Effective preconstruction planning is important, as it lays the groundwork for all subsequent phases and helps prevent delays later in the project.

## Construction Phase

The construction phase is when the contractor and subcontractors execute the construction plan (although the design, engineering and architecture teams aren’t out of the picture and consulted throughout this phase). This phase is the most critical for the people this software is intended for and therefore the most critical reference point of this document.

### Site

Site work happens throughout the entire life of the project. Often depending on what phase the actual structure is in at that time. Site work includes bringing utilities to the structure, paving and sidewalk installation, final grading and landscape work.

### Foundation Construction (Ground Stage)

Foundation construction is one of the most important stages of construction as it helps provide stability for the entire structure. It could include creating a slab, crawlspace or basement and typically includes reinforcements such as rebar and concrete. This stage is commonly referred to as the Ground Stage. The MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) trades and some site trades will work hand in hand with concrete trades to get their work in place before a slab is poured which initiates the Rough stage.

### Structural Construction (Rough Stage)

This refers to the building of a structure once the foundation has been built. It includes all building elements that rise above the ground including floors, walls, roofs and architectural features. This stage is commonly referred to as Rough, Structural or Frame Stage.

### Exterior Envelope and Weatherproofing (Rough)

The exterior envelope phase is essential for sealing the building against the elements. Achieving a weather-tight seal at this stage safeguards the project from potential setbacks, such as water infiltration, mold growth, or temperature fluctuations, all of which can disrupt subsequent phases and may result in cost overruns.

The primary objective is to “dry in” the structure as quickly as possible. This involves closing up the exterior to prevent water intrusion, which can lead to costly rework, mold issues and delays in interior work.

Exterior facades must be installed (e.g., cladding, siding, or curtain walls) which has over the years become an increasingly complex process that requires coordination with structural components and ongoing interior work.

Once an exterior facade is inplace, waterproofing and insulation can begin. Proper waterproofing protects the building from moisture infiltration. This includes applying membranes, sealants and drainage systems. Adding insulation at this stage helps regulate interior temperatures and improves energy efficiency.

Exterior envelope work often overlaps with interior rough-in, requiring careful synchronization. If the exterior isn’t sealed in time, it can disrupt interior construction activities and lead to scheduling conflicts, increased risk and potential damage to installed systems.

### Interior Work (Rough)

The interior rough-in phase is dedicated to the installation of mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems, which provide the building’s essential functions. There are also speciality contractors operating in this space at the same time which depend on the buildings requirements. But they include fire suppression, fire controls and audio/visual contractors. 

Framing contractors layout the interior structure of the building for these MEP trades to utilize for their work. This stage requires close coordination among all trades, as work that often overlaps and must be synchronized to avoid conflicts and allows for efficient installation. The spaces being left open for these systems gets more condensed every year, requiring more and more time be spent coordinating these specific systems.

On many projects, interior rough-in begins before the structural phase is fully complete, leading to a practice known as phase stacking. Phase stacking involves starting later phases before the previous ones are fully completed. While this overlap can accelerate the timeline, it also demands precise planning to keep the project on track and prevent delays or costly rework.

### Interior Finishes (Final)

The interior finishes phase marks the final push to complete the interior spaces and prepare the building for occupancy. This stage involves installing drywall, cabinetry, light fixtures, plumbing fixtures and completing tasks like painting and trim work that give the project its finished look. Many of these tasks require a high level of craftsmanship and attention to detail, as they are among the most visible elements of the build. 

While this phase signals that the end of the project is near, it often comes with its own set of challenges. Compressed timelines are common, especially when ownership groups push for early move-in dates. The increased schedule pressure can place heavy demands on these trades, making it difficult to maintain quality while meeting tight deadlines.

### Turnover and Closeout

The final phase of the project, known as closeout, involves handing over the building to the client and completing any remaining tasks before formal closure. The general contractor transitions the project to the building management team, guaranteeing that all systems are fully operational and that the client is satisfied with the completed work. 

This stage typically includes obtaining the certificate of occupancy, confirming that the building meets all safety and regulatory requirements for use. Final inspections and walkthroughs are conducted to help identify and resolve punch list items, allowing the project to be officially closed out. The general contractor also provides ongoing support through warranty work, handling any defects or concerns that may arise after the building is occupied.

### Warranty Period

Depending on the project's requirements there may be a warranty period established after turnover has happened. This stage doesn't usually require active work, but must be tracked internally for cost purposes in case they have to return to the project to address any warranty claims.
