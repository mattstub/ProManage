> **Note**: This file needs construction industry terminology. Please add industry-specific terms and acronyms as you encounter them.

## General Construction Terms
<!-- Add construction industry terms here -->

**Joist:** Horizontal framing members, often made of wood or steel, that extend from one end of an open space to another. Joists run parallel and sit atop beams to provide stiffness to floors and redistribute loads to vertical beams on roofs.

**Parapet:** A wall or railing that borders a balcony, porch, roof, or deck to prevent people from falling over the edge.

**Purlins:** Horizontal beams or rails in a roof structure that run parallel to the eaves. Purlins offer extra support in long spans and secure the rafters together.

**Rafter:** The sloped beams that form a roof’s frame, connecting the wall to the roof’s hip. Sometimes known as “stick framing.”

**Red Iron:** A type of steel coated with red iron oxide, giving it a reddish tint. This extra layer creates a barrier that protects the steel from corrosive elements like acid rain.

**Truss:** A webbing of interconnected triangles made of wood or steel. Most often used to create long, single-object spans in roofing and towers.

**Shoring:** Using metal or wood props (aka “shores”) to hold up a part of a structure during repair or to prevent collapse in a building under construction.

**Girts:** A lateral support structure in a building intended to resist wind damage. Girts run horizontally along a structure’s exterior wall panels.

**Flatwork:** Concrete slabs poured horizontally (flooring, ramps, sidewalks, loading docks, etc).

**Eaves:** Roofing that hangs over the edge of a wall or fence, projecting from the side of a building to create a slight overhang.

**Drywall:** The simplest method for creating interior walls and ceilings. Drywall consists of paper backing on either side, gypsum on the interior, and a notable lack of mortar.

**Building Envelope:** The layer of the building that separates indoors from outdoors. This includes the exterior walls, roof, foundation, windows, and doors. You can learn about some building envelope styles in this article: Building Fronts: Double-Skin Facade vs. Storefront vs. Curtain Wall.

**Blocking:** Wedging blocks of defective wood between floor joists or wall studs to add further structural support or fill gaps.

**Backfill:** The material or soil removed from a hole, ditch, or trench dug before laying a concrete slab or piping. Often used to fill the voids surrounding a freshly laid foundation.

**Aggregate:** Raw natural materials, often medium or coarse-grained, used in construction to create mortar or concrete. Aggregate includes materials like crushed stone, gravel, sand, fill, and slag.

**Abutment:** Supporting structure at each end of a single span bridge. Types of abutments vary based on geotechnical, geographic, and constructability factors.

**Back charge:** A charge against a contractor’s contract for costs incurred by another party that should have been incurred by the contractor. A back charge typically takes form in a deductive change order. For example, if the contractor in charge of fire sprinklers damaged a wall using a boom lift, that contractor may incur a back charge from the drywall contractor for the repair work.

**Commissioning:** The process of testing and verifying the intended behavior of the building systems, such as HVAC, plumbing, electrical, life safety, lighting, etc. This is generally conducted by the contractor in tandem with the facility management team in order to ensure that the building staff are prepared to operate and maintain its systems and equipment.

**Embankment:** An elevated landmass made of compacted soil or aggregate. Embankments help create roads and level surfaces for slabs or levees.

**Field Order:** A work order issued to a contractor by the owner or general contractor to perform work not included in the contract. The contractor will then be entitled to a change order for the extra work. Field orders are used to expedite work in an emergency or crucial situation, when there is no time to compile and approve a change order request.

**Grade and Compact:** The process of leveling out an area of land and exerting force using heavy equipment to stabilize the soil or aggregate.

**HVAC Zone:** A space or group of spaces within a building with heating, cooling, and ventilating requirements that are sufficiently similar so that desired conditions (e.g., temperature) can be maintained throughout using a single sensor (e.g., thermostat or temperature sensor).

**Liquidated Damages:** An amount of money that the contractor would owe the owner in the event of a breach of contract. These are typically calculated by a formula such as $10,000 per day of substantial delay of completion.

**Preliminary notice:** Documents notifying other parties that they are working on the project. They’re often required to preserve mechanics lien rights. But even when not required, they provide invaluable transparency and communication.

**Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC):** This stands for "quality assurance/quality control" which is the formalized process of confirming proper installation methods and materials on-site.

**Rough-in:** The initial stage of the wall framing, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing installation. This includes all of the components that won’t be seen after the completion of the project. All trade rough-ins must generally be inspected prior to insulation and application of finishes.

## Construction Roles

**Architect:** Architects are the creative visionaries who design buildings and structures that not only inspire but also serve communities. They work directly with clients to draw detailed plans that dwell on aesthetics, functionality, and building codes in the process, then subsequently consult with clients and engineers through construction. Often lack the real life experience to understand how their ideas will actually come together in the field.

**Interior Designer:**
<!-- TODO: define role -->

**Civil Engineer:** Civil Engineers are the geniuses who carry out projects of infrastructural development such as roads, bridges, and buildings. They assess the site, develop a design, and oversee construction to make sure that all work complies with code requirements and safety standards. These professionals ensure that the structure is apt, efficient, and environmentally safe.

**Structural Engineer:** Structural engineers are the custodians of safety and stability. They analyze designs, undertake calculations, and work in collaboration with architects and construction teams – developing and verifying structural plans – to check that buildings survive natural disasters and the test of time.

**Mechanical Engineer:** Mechanical engineers design and manage the installation processes of all mechanical systems in commercial buildings, including green roofing. It ensures that the systems are energy and resource-efficient, providing reliability and functioning with building and safety codes.

**Electrical Engineer:** Electrical engineers prepare plans and supervise the installation of electrical systems. These engineers also ensure that such electrical systems are safe and meet all the set standards and regulations. To light the way towards safe and effective constructions, electrical engineers prepare layouts, supervise various installations, and operate tests pertaining to systems.

**Landscape Architect:** They draw landscape design plans and the number of plant materials to be used. They are in charge of overseeing the implementation of landscapes that can be found outdoors—parks, gardens, and recreational areas. They prepare the drawing layout, select vegetation, and produce design plans.

**Project Manager:** A project manager is an individual who has been identified as the most important person in any construction project due to the fact that they are involved in planning, executing, and completing the aspects of projects. A project manager is one who makes sure that the project is delivered within a set time, within budget, and the quality and standards of the deliverables are met. A project manager is an individual who makes all decisions and solves problems at any stage of a project: its conceptualization, planning, execution, and completion.

**Project Engineer:** Project Engineers provide technical support in construction works, whereby engineering designs are carried out correctly, safely, and efficiently. He applies his expertise to technical problems and ensures that projects conform to the desired standards.

**Safety Inspector:** Safety Inspectors make periodic checks for possible safety hazards at construction sites and ensure that rules regarding safety and standards are strictly followed. They write reports and send recommendations to site managers and safety teams to improve safety conditions.

**Safety Consultant:** Safety Consultants provide expert advice to organizations on best practices and regulations for safety. They help shape safety programs and policies, conducting audits and providing recommendations to improve safety conditions. Safety consultants also advise on daily operations like site layout and waste management. A key part of their advice is planning for safe waste disposal. This includes actions like renting dumpsters to keep work areas clean and reduce trip hazards. By managing waste properly, companies can meet safety standards and create a safer workplace.

**Laborer:**
<!-- TODO: define role -->

**Chief Estimator:** The chief estimator is the one leading the estimators' department. He is to give cost estimates involving accurate project analysis and specification cost. He is to ensure that all construction projects bring forth the most economical plans and minimize incidences of cost overruns.

**Construction Manager (CM):** A construction manager manages projects from initiation and execution to completion through proper handling of budget schedules and ensuring the observance of building codes. The CM is responsible for conducting day-to-day activities at the construction site together with contractors and solving problems that arise.

**General Contractor (GC):** A company or person who signs the primary contract with the construction project owner. General commercial contractors oversee day-to-day operations and hire subcontractors to complete the project within the decided-upon budget and deadline.

**Subcontractor (SC):** A company or skilled worker hired during the course of a construction project, often on a contractual basis. Plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and roofers are all examples of subcontractors.

**Superintendent:** A management-level employee responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations on a construction site, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and according to safety and quality standards. They coordinate crews, manage subcontractors, and serve as the main point of contact between the project team and various stakeholders.

**Foreman:** The highly skilled leader of a construction crew who oversees operations at the job site.

**Plumber:** Plumbers are thus the important unsung heroes of construction, installing, or repairing piping facilities intended for water, gas, or sewage. They read blueprints, assemble pipe sections, and test systems for leaks so waters are disposed of safely and waste flows.

**Welder:** Welders are skilled in creating metal joints with strong and neat connections on which the durability of construction work depends. They read blueprints and prepare materials for welding while performing welding tasks with precision and care.

**Electrician:** Electricians are really the lifeblood of construction projects. They install, maintain, and repair electrical systems in buildings or within a construction site to ensure that the standards and codes related to their installation are met and that they are safe. Electricians do much detailed work: problems are localized with the finest focus on details, replacements of problematic components are made, and proper system operations are ensured.

**Mason:** Masons build and repair structures using bricks, stones, and concrete blocks, creating a sense of stability and good appearance. They mix mortar, lay bricks or stones, and finish surfaces to accomplish pleasing results that leave a lasting impression.

**Roofer:** Roofers install and repair roofing systems, waterproofing and weatherproofing them. They choose the right materials; subsequently, they set the roof systems and maintain them properly to protect the buildings underneath from being wet and unsafe.

**Painter:** Painters apply paint, stain, varnish, or other finishes on buildings and other infrastructures, ensuring protection and improvement in the aesthetics of the building.

**Carpenter:** Carpenters act as framers and builders of structures. This involves building stairways, door frames, and partitions, fastening them together by use of materials such as wood, among others. They also lay out materials to be measured, cut, or shaped and then assembled into designed structures.

**Drywaller:** Drywallers measure and cut panels and fasten them to walls and ceilings. They achieve even and correct finishing surfaces without projections by taping and filling joints and holes to hide unattractive seams and imperfections.

**Ironworker:** Ironworkers assemble and erect structural steel frameworks for buildings, bridges, and other structures. They position steel members, align them, and bolt or weld them together to create the skeleton of a construction project. Sometimes called steel workers.

**Equipment Operator:** Construction equipment operators run and manage machinery around a construction site, ensuring it is operated properly and maintained. They keep projects on schedule and in compliance with site plans.

**Pipelayer:** Pipelayers install sewer systems for water, gas, and other fluids or slurries. They ensure that all pipes are correctly aligned and attached to required structures. They dig trenches, lay pipes into the ground, and test the systems.

## Cost & Budgeting Terms

**Cost Code:** A cost code is a classification used to map individual project costs into your accounting system to support bookkeeping as well as financial reporting. Each code is part of a cost category and consists of a name and numeric characters that align with the category it falls under. When creating an estimate, each line item will have a cost code which is then tied to that item's quantity, markup, and cost.

**Budget Line Item:** A specific entry in a budget that details a particular expense related to a project, such as materials, labor, or permits. This allows for clear tracking and management of costs associated with each aspect of the construction process

**Cost-Plus Contract:** Is an agreement between a homeowner and contractor, whereby the client agrees to pay all of the project costs plus a set fee to the contractor for managing the project. This additional fee, or management fee, is typically negotiated prior to the start of a project and represents compensation for the contractor's services in overseeing and managing the entire project from beginning to end. The fees associated with cost-plus management contracts often cover costs such as organizing subcontractors, ordering materials, dealing with suppliers, scheduling work crews, coordinating work among multiple tradespeople, and monitoring quality control. This type of contract also usually includes provisions to handle any issues that arise during construction, such as delays or unexpected expenses due to unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, these agreements tend to include language that address payment terms as well as any disputes that could arise between parties. 

**Lump Sum Contract:** Where a fixed amount is agreed upon between the owner and the contractor for the completion of a specific scope of work. The lump sum contract is a popular choice for projects with clearly defined scopes because it offers a firm price for the work to be completed. This type of contract is also preferred when the client wants to limit the risks of cost overrun due to design changes, labor issues, or other unforeseen events. Under a lump sum contract, the contractor assumes the risk of completing the work within the agreed upon amount. The contractor is responsible for any additional costs that may arise during the course of the project, unless they were caused by the client's actions or omissions. The client, on the other hand, benefits from the predictability of the contract price and the assurance that the project will be completed within budget. Lump sum contracts are typically used for smaller, simpler projects such as residential homes, commercial buildings, and some infrastructure projects. They are less commonly used for larger and more complex projects where the scope of work is not well-defined or where design changes are likely to occur. In these cases, alternative contract types such as cost-plus contracts may be more appropriate.

**Unit Price:** a unit is a clearly defined portion of work that includes all costs needed to complete it. A unit accounts for five key cost factors: labor, materials, equipment, overhead, and profit. For pricing accuracy, each unit must be clearly defined and consistent. If project requirements change—such as using a different material or increasing labor hours—a new, separate unit with its own price must be created. This structure ensures transparency, simplifies cost tracking, and prevents disputes over pricing adjustments.

**Contingency:** The cost provisions in the project budget that make allowance for oversights and unforeseen circumstances associated with the project. Depending on the nature of the contract, the contractor may require owner’s approval to draw funds from contingencies.

**Retention (or Retainage):** A portion of the contract payment that is withheld by the project owner or general contractor until the project is substantially complete. This practice serves as a financial incentive for contractors to ensure that the work is completed satisfactorily and to address any defects or issues that may arise.

**Estimate:** A prediction for how much it’ll cost to build a new structure. Construction estimates factor in labor, materials, permits, legal fees, equipment rentals, and general construction costs.

**Schedule of Values (SOV):** The breakdown of a contract amount into sub-items and sub-costs for identifiable construction elements. This is usually used as the basis for submitting and reviewing progress payment.

**Take off:** An estimation of the quantity of material required to complete a certain scope of work.

## Scheduling Terms

**Substantial Completion:** A milestone in construction projects defined as the stage when work is sufficiently completed in accordance with the contract documents. This indicates that the owner can now utilize the building or facility for its intended purpose. Only minor works, such as punch list items, will ordinarily remain after reaching substantial completion.

**Critical Path:** Is the longest sequence of dependent tasks that must be completed on time for the entire project to finish on schedule. Any delay in a critical path task will directly impact the project's completion date.

**Milestone:** A key date or event that marks significant progress in a project, such as the start or completion of major phases of work. These milestones help track the project's timeline and ensure it stays on schedule and within budget

**Lead Time:** The total time required to complete a project from the initial planning stage to final delivery. It includes all phases of the project, such as obtaining materials, scheduling tasks, and executing the construction work.

**Float (or Slack):** The amount of time that a task can be delayed without affecting the overall project completion date. It provides flexibility in scheduling, allowing project managers to adjust timelines as needed without causing delays to subsequent tasks or the project as a whole.

**Baseline Schedule:** The original plan that outlines the project's scope, schedule, and cost, serving as a benchmark for measuring progress and performance throughout the project. It helps project managers track deviations and manage changes effectively.

## Safety & Compliance

**OSHA:** Stands for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is a U.S. government agency responsible for ensuring safe and healthy working conditions for employees in various industries, including construction. It sets and enforces standards to protect workers from hazards on the job site.

**Safety Data Sheet (SDS):** A document that outlines the hazards associated with specific tasks in the construction industry and provides safety precautions to mitigate those risks. It serves as a resource for workers to understand the safety measures necessary for performing their jobs safely.

**Toolbox Talk:** A short safety meeting focused on a specific health and safety topic relevant to the day's work. These talks aim to refresh workers' knowledge and ensure everyone is aware of potential hazards on the job site.

**Job Hazard Analysis (JHA):** A systematic process used in construction to identify potential hazards associated with specific job tasks and implement measures to control or eliminate those hazards. By breaking down a job into its steps, JHA helps ensure worker safety and compliance with safety regulations.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** This stands for "personal protective equipment" which is basically the proper attire for a construction job. Such equipment often includes a hard hat, hard-soled boots, reflective vest, safety glasses, long pants, and a shirt with at least 6” long sleeves.

**Accident:** A jobsite-related event that causes injury or ill health to a construction worker.

**Compliance:** Legally adhering to safety rules and regulations as set by governing legislation and regulatory agencies. Although not totally mandated in every sector of the construction industry, companies impacted by compliance can be liable for fines if they don’t adhere to the regulations.

**Emergency Action Plan (EAP):** A document detailing the appropriate procedures necessary to perform during an emergency at the jobsite. Any construction company required to have an EAP must make sure its workers are trained in plan procedures as well.

**Entry Permit:** A document indicating a specific space within a jobsite has been inspected and assessed as safe to enter.

**Environmental Hazards:** A substance or event occurring within the surrounding natural environment that could impact workers’ health while at a jobsite. At a construction jobsite, some environmental hazards include gas emissions from machinery and extreme temperatures.

**Emergency Response Plan (ERP):** A legally mandated plan providing information, guidelines and procedures to use during an emergency.

**Fall Hazard:** Anything at a jobsite that could cause accidental loss of balance or body control, leading to a fall. Major fall hazards at construction sites include improper scaffolding and unprotected edges.

**Fall Protection:** Controls used to prevent workers from losing their balance and falling or — in the event of a fall — catch the worker before they’re injured. Fall protection is one of the most common OSHA violations in the construction industry.

**GHS Hazard Communication Standards:** An internationally recognized set of standards used to train workers to identify chemical hazards based on the information provided on the product label and in Safety Data Sheets.

**Incident Report:** A formal document detailing the facts related to an incident at a jobsite.

**Lockout, Tagout (LOTO):** A safety procedure used to ensure dangerous safety equipment is properly shut-off and cannot be used again after maintenance work is finished. The technique involves locking the machine up with some type of security system (for example, a padlock) and then tagging the security system to warn workers against use.

**Near-Miss:** An unplanned, close call event that has the potential to cause injury, harm or loss but doesn’t actually result in any damage. On a construction site, for example, a worker may slip while carrying a heavy object but doesn’t fall or get injured.

## Documentation

**Addendum:** Any documentation (drawings, specifications, etc.) issued during the bidding process to modify, clarify, or complement the information outlined in the bidding documents. Addenda become part of the contract documents upon awarding of the contract to a firm.

**Specifications:** The instruction manual that is paired with the contract drawings. It includes information such as installation procedures, product brand requirements, and testing requirements, to name a few. It is separated out by CSI (Construction Specification Institute) divisions, generally starting with 01 00 00 through 33 00 00.

**Change Order (CO):** A change to the original contract scope of work, resulting in either an increase or decrease in project costs and/or schedule. This could be issued by a client to the general contractor or the general contractor to a subcontractor.

**Requestion for Information (RFI):** This stands for "request for information" which is a formal question to the design team, client, or general contractor that will likely affect the contract scope, drawings, and/or specifications. The response to an RFI acts as a contract change and could result in a change order.

**Submittal:** A document that is prepared by the installing contractor that indicates the products and locations that will be procured and installed. The document will need to be approved by the architect (and other applicable design team members), as well as the general contractor and client. An example of a submittal would be a cut sheet of the sink that will be installed in the bathrooms. This information is generally provided by manufacturers in the form of Product Data

**Punch List:** A list of all items that need to be fixed before the building or project can be turned over to the client. Punch list items are also known as snags or deficiencies, and include things like paint scratches, damaged siding, cleanup, etc. This process comes at the end of the project after a preliminary walkthrough of the jobsite. The final punch list is usually tied to a cost withheld from the contractor until it is completed and verified.

**As-Built:** The common term for marked up floor plans (usually in red ink) showing how installation differed from the original design drawings. As-builts are usually created for utilities and in-wall systems that aren’t directly visible. The formal term for as-builts is record drawings.

**Shop Drawings:** Detailed plans created by contractors or fabricators that illustrate how specific components of a construction project will be manufactured, assembled, and installed. They provide precise dimensions, materials, and installation instructions, ensuring that the final product aligns with the architect's design intent and complies with relevant codes.

**Daily Report (or Daily Log):** A record of field notes, including work completed, weather conditions, and materials delivered or used on-site.

**Progress Photos:** Images taken at various stages of a project to document its development and changes over time. These photos help track progress, communicate updates to stakeholders, and serve as a visual record for future reference.

**Certified Payroll:** A billing method where a contractor submits invoices that are verified and approved by a third party, often a project manager or architect, to ensure that the work completed meets the contract specifications before payment is made. This process helps maintain transparency and accountability in financial transactions within construction projects.

**AIA Billing (Application for Payment):** A standardized invoicing process used in the construction industry to request payments for completed work. It involves specific forms, primarily the G702 and G703, which help ensure clarity and consistency in billing between contractors and project owners.

**O&M Manual:** This stands for operations and maintenance manual which is an instruction guide to running and servicing a building. The O&M manual is given to the owner at turnover.
